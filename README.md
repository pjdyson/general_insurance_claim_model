# general_insurance_data_model
Module to generate artificial data to test reserving engines

## Overview
The intention of this module is to allow the generation of a simple set of data which represents a set of insurance policies. The data generated can then be used to share demonstrations of new actuarial processes, models and software.
While there is really no substitute for real data, this is often commercially sensitive, so this may be the next best thing to help share ideas and solutions within the community.
